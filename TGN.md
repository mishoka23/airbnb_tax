## 2. State Machines

### 2a. User Account Status

```
                    ┌─────────┐
            signup  │         │
           ────────►│ pending │
                    │         │
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
            ┌────────────┼────────────┐
            ▼            ▼            ▼
       ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
       │ approved │ │ rejected │ │suspended │
       └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
            │                         ▲
            └─────────────────────────┘
                    (admin action)
```

**Rules:**
- `pending` users can log in and view dashboards but cannot post jobs, apply, or accept assignments.
- `approved` → `suspended` by admin action.
- `rejected` is terminal for marketplace access.
- Admin email is sent to all `role=admin` or `is_staff=True` users on every `pending` creation.

### 2b. Cleaner Verification Status

```
┌────────────┐   admin verifies   ┌──────────┐
│unverified  │──────────────────►│ verified  │
└────────────┘                    └──────────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Cleaners must be `verified` AND `approved` before applying for any job.
- Verification UI in admin panel: **not yet built**.

### 2c. Cleaning Job Lifecycle

```
                   ┌───────┐
      host creates │       │
     ─────────────►│ draft │
                   │       │
                   └───┬───┘
                       │ publish
                       ▼
                   ┌───────┐
                   │       │◄── cleaners apply
                   │ open  │
                   │       │
                   └───┬───┘
            ┌──────────┤
            │ cancelled│ assigned (host accepts application)
            ▼          ▼
       ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
       │cancelled │  │ assigned │
       └──────────┘  └────┬─────┘
                          │
               ┌──────────┼───────────┐
               │ completed│ disputed  │
               ▼          ▼           │
          ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐   │
          │completed │ │ disputed │◄──┘
          └──────────┘ └──────────┘
               │
               └──► reviews unlocked (both directions)
```

**Rules:**
- Only one `Assignment` per job (enforced at service layer).
- Competing applications are rejected when one is accepted.
- Reviews only allowed after `completed`.
- `disputed` requires admin inspection (not yet built).

### 2d. Cleaner Application Lifecycle

```
              ┌─────────┐
  cleaner     │         │
  applies ───►│ pending │
              │         │
              └────┬────┘
                   │
       ┌───────────┼───────────┐
       ▼           ▼           ▼
  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
  │ accepted │ │ rejected │ │withdrawn │
  └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
       │
       └──► Assignment created
            Other applications → rejected
```

### 2e. Agency Invitation & Membership

```
Agency Invitation:
  pending ──► accepted ──► [AgencyMembership: pending → active]
           └► expired / declined

Agency Membership:
  active ──► revoked   (admin or agency action)
```

**Rules:**
- Agency can assign work only to `active` members.
- Member cleaner must also be `approved` + `verified` to receive agency work.

## 3. Module Dependency Graph

Backend apps in `backend/apps/`. Arrows = "imports models/services from".

```
notifications ◄─────────── accounts
      ▲
      │
   accounts ◄───────────── properties
      ▲                         ▲
      │                         │
   marketplace ◄────────────────┘
      ▲
      │
   calendars ◄──────────── properties
                ◄──────────── marketplace

   feedback ◄────────────── accounts
            ◄────────────── marketplace
```

**Hard rules:**
- No app imports from an app to its right in the dependency chain.
- `accounts` has zero imports from other domain apps.
- `notifications` may import `accounts` (to look up admin emails) but nothing else.
- Cross-domain workflows use explicit service functions — never reach into another app's ORM directly from a view.

### Config layer (`backend/config/`)

```
settings.py ──► loaded by all apps at startup
celery.py   ──► wires Celery to Django settings
manage.py   ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
wsgi.py     ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
asgi.py     ──► calls load_dotenv() before Django setup
```

---

## 4. Frontend Route Graph

Each route node lists: auth requirement, role gate, data sources (API calls), and write actions.

```
/ (landing)
  auth: optional
  reads: GET /api/accounts/me/   (to set header link)
  writes: none
  next: /login, /signup, /host, /admin, /app

/login
  auth: no
  reads: none
  writes: POST /api/accounts/login/
  next: / (on success)

/signup
  auth: no
  reads: none
  writes: POST /api/accounts/signup/
  next: /app (on success) ──► triggers send_admin_new_account_email

/app
  auth: required
  reads: GET /api/accounts/me/
  redirects: host → /host, admin → /admin
  shows: account status for cleaner/agency

/admin                            [role: admin only]
  auth: required
  reads: GET /api/accounts/users/
  reads param: ?filter=pending   (pre-selects tab; used in email approval links)
  writes: POST /api/accounts/users/{id}/approve/
          POST /api/accounts/users/{id}/reject/
  NOT YET: cleaner verification action

          POST /api/marketplace/jobs/{id}/publish/  (draft → open)
          POST /api/properties/parse-ics/           (ICS upload → parsed events)
  NOT YET: GET /api/marketplace/applications/       (per-job applications)
           POST /api/marketplace/applications/{id}/accept/

/cleaner  [NOT BUILT]             [role: cleaner only]
  planned reads: GET /api/accounts/me/
                 GET /api/marketplace/jobs/?status=open
                 GET /api/marketplace/applications/?mine=true
  planned writes: POST /api/marketplace/applications/

/agency   [NOT BUILT]             [role: agency only]
  planned reads: GET /api/accounts/me/
                 GET /api/accounts/agency-memberships/
                 GET /api/marketplace/assignments/
  planned writes: POST /api/marketplace/assignments/{id}/assign-member/
                  POST /api/accounts/agencies/{id}/invite-cleaner/

## 6. Event & Task Graph

Domain events and the Celery tasks or side effects they trigger.

```
EVENT: account.created (signup)
  └──► TASK: send_admin_new_account_email          ✅ implemented
              │  reads: User.objects.filter(role=admin OR is_staff=True)
              │  sends: email with name, role, approve_link
              │  approve_link = FRONTEND_URL/admin?filter=pending
              │  retries: 3× with 60s delay on SMTP failure
              └──► SIDE EFFECT: admin redirected to /admin?filter=pending (via email link)

  └──► TASK: review prompt to both parties (scheduled delay)

EVENT: review.submitted                            ⬜ planned
  └──► SIDE EFFECT: CleanerProfile.rating recalculated

EVENT: calendar.sync_failed                        ⬜ planned
  └──► TASK: notify affected user + admins

SCHEDULED: ical.feed_poll (per ExternalCalendarConnection)  ⬜ placeholder
  └──► SIDE EFFECT: new Reservation records, conflict check

SCHEDULED: google.calendar.sync                    ⬜ placeholder (OAuth not started)
```

### Celery task registry

| Task | Module | Status | Retry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `send_admin_new_account_email` | `apps.notifications.tasks` | ✅ | 3× / 60s |
| `dispatch_notification` | `apps.notifications.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `poll_ical_feed` | `apps.calendars.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `sync_google_calendar` | `apps.calendars.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `check_calendar_conflicts` | `apps.calendars.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `send_sms` | `apps.notifications.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `schedule_review_prompt` | `apps.notifications.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |
| `retry_failed_integrations` | `apps.notifications.tasks` | ⬜ placeholder | — |

**Local fallback:** When `celery` is not installed, `_FakeTask` in `apps/notifications/tasks.py` wraps every task and executes it synchronously. `.delay()` and `.apply()` are both supported. `bind=True` tasks receive a `_FakeTaskSelf` stub with `.retry()`.

```

`DATABASE_URL` must be **absent or commented out** in local `.env`.
Docker passes it via `env_file:` with the `db` hostname valid inside the container network.

## 10. Critical Rules Index

Rules that must never be broken regardless of task scope.

| # | Rule | Where enforced |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | A job has at most one accepted `Assignment` | Service layer — `marketplace/services.py` |
| R2 | Reviews only after job `completed` | Service layer + serializer permission |
| R3 | Cleaners must be `verified` + `approved` before applying | Permission class in marketplace views |
| R4 | Agencies assign only to `active` members | Service layer — agency delegation |
| R5 | No payment processing in v1 | Architecture constraint |
| R6 | Internal calendar is source of truth | Calendar module owns conflict detection |
| R7 | Never set `Content-Type` for FormData | `frontend/lib/api.ts` — typeof body check |
| R8 | Never call `fetch` directly — use `apiFetch` | Frontend convention |
| R9 | Never commit `.env` | `.gitignore` |
| R10 | `trailingSlash: true` + dual API rewrite — do not simplify | `frontend/next.config.mjs` |
| R11 | `load_dotenv(override=False)` — shell env wins | `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py` |
| R12 | `DATABASE_URL` commented out in local `.env` | `.env` (Docker hostname `db` is invalid locally) |
| R13 | All Celery tasks must be idempotent and retryable | `apps/notifications/tasks.py` convention |
| R14 | Public `/` is marketing only — never a dashboard | Frontend routing |
| R15 | Timezone `Europe/Sofia`; store UTC, display local | All datetime handling |
