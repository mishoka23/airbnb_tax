# Agent Instructions

## Restart Handoff

Before doing more deployment work, read `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md`. Docker Desktop requires a Windows restart, and container build/start verification has not run yet.

## Mission

Help build and maintain a Bulgarian-market marketplace that connects short-term rental hosts with verified cleaners.

The product direction for v1 is:

- Responsive web/PWA.
- Public landing page first, with marketplace operations behind authenticated app screens later.
- Session-cookie authentication with manual admin approval for v1.
- Django REST Framework backend.
- React/Next.js frontend.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery.
- Bulgarian and English UI.
- EUR currency.
- Verified cleaners.
- Agency accounts that invite separate cleaner users into agency groups.
- Consent-first cookie handling for optional analytics and marketing cookies.
- Single cleaning and monthly batch posting.
- Bulk cleaning job creation from Airbnb iCal calendar imports.
- Google Calendar sync and iCal import/export.
- Email notifications via Django's mail backend (SMTP in production).
- Two-way reviews.
- No in-app payments in v1.

## Working Rules

- Treat `BUSINESS.md` as the source of truth for business strategy, target users, marketplace assumptions, monetization hypotheses, and open business questions.
- Preserve the service-ready modular architecture described in `architecture.md`.
- Keep the unauthenticated `/` frontend experience as a public marketing/lead-generation landing page, not an internal dashboard.
- Keep changes scoped to the user request.
- Do not introduce unrelated refactors.
- Do not add payment processing, payouts, wallets, invoices, or platform fees unless the user explicitly asks for that change.
- Prefer explicit business services for workflows instead of burying state transitions in API views.
- Keep calendar behavior centered on the internal app calendar as the source of truth.
- Keep Bulgarian-market assumptions visible: BG/EN, EUR, `Europe/Sofia`, verified cleaners, no in-app payments, two-way reviews.

## Documentation Rules

Update docs in the same change when altering:

- Business strategy, target users, monetization assumptions, launch strategy, or success metrics.
- Architecture boundaries.
- Business workflows.
- Data model concepts.
- API routes or behavior.
- Local development commands.
- Test commands.
- External integrations.
- Deployment assumptions.

Use:

- `TGN.md` for the full project knowledge graph — entities, relationships, state machines, API surface, event triggers, and critical rules. Read this first in every new session.
- `README.md` for project overview and quick-start entry points.
- `BUSINESS.md` for business strategy, target market, user segments, monetization hypotheses, success metrics, risks, and open business questions.
- `DEV.md` for developer setup and project operating instructions.
- `architecture.md` for technical architecture and domain boundaries.
- `AGENT.md` for agent-specific working rules.

When documents overlap, use this priority:

- `BUSINESS.md` decides what the business is trying to achieve and which assumptions are locked.
- `architecture.md` decides how the system is structured technically.
- `DEV.md` decides how developers run and maintain the project.
- `AGENT.md` decides how agents should work inside the repository.

## Code Quality Rules

When code exists:

- Add or update tests for business logic, API behavior, migrations, permissions, and background tasks.
- Keep migrations intentional and reviewable.
- Avoid cross-domain imports that bypass service boundaries.
- Prefer typed, explicit interfaces for shared workflow inputs.
- Make background jobs idempotent where possible.
- Handle external calendar and notification failures explicitly — retry with backoff, never silently swallow.
- Keep secrets out of source control — use `.env` (never committed) and `.env.example` (committed, no real values).
- Do not run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running against the same `frontend/.next` directory; stop dev or clear `.next` first to avoid stale Next.js runtime errors.
- Never call `fetch` directly in the frontend — always use `apiFetch` from `frontend/lib/api.ts`.
- Never set `Content-Type: application/json` for `FormData` bodies — let the browser set the multipart boundary.

## Marketplace Rules To Preserve

- Cleaners must be verified before applying for marketplace jobs.
- Users must be approved before full marketplace rights are enabled.
- Agencies must assign accepted agency jobs only to active member cleaners.
- Hosts can post one cleaning or a monthly batch, or bulk-import from an Airbnb `.ics` file.
- Cleaners apply; hosts accept or reject.
- Price can be proposed or agreed in the app, but payment is handled outside the platform in v1.
- A cleaning job can have only one accepted cleaner assignment.
- Reviews are two-way and only allowed after job completion.
- Admins must be able to inspect marketplace history for disputes and moderation.

## Current Implementation State

### Backend — what is implemented

**Auth and accounts (`apps/accounts`)**

- Session-cookie auth with CSRF enforcement on all auth views.
- Account approval states: pending, approved, rejected, suspended.
- Admin approve / reject / suspend actions.
- Host, cleaner, agency, and admin role profiles.
- Agency invitations and memberships.
- Cookie consent records.
- Admin email notification on new account signup — `send_admin_new_account_email` Celery task:
  - Sends to all `role=admin` or `is_staff=True` users (excluding blank emails and inactive accounts).
  - Email includes name, email, phone, role, and a direct link to the admin panel with `?filter=pending`.
  - Retries up to 3 times with 60-second delays on SMTP failure.
  - Falls back to synchronous execution when Celery is not installed (via `_FakeTask` stub in `apps/notifications/tasks.py`).

**Properties (`apps/properties`)**

- Property CRUD with address, timezone, default cleaning duration, and default price.
- External calendar connections and reservation records.
- **ICS file parsing** — `POST /api/properties/parse-ics/`:
  - Accepts multipart upload with `ics_file` field.
  - Parses VEVENT entries using the `icalendar` library.
  - Filters Airbnb blocked-date placeholders (entries whose summary contains "not available", "blocked", or "unavailable").
  - Normalises `DTSTART`/`DTEND` from `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.date` to plain `date`.
  - Returns `[{uid, summary, checkin, checkout, nights}]` sorted by checkin date.

**Marketplace (`apps/marketplace`)**

- Cleaning job CRUD (draft → open → assigned → completed lifecycle).
- Monthly batch CRUD.
- Cleaner applications.
- Application acceptance (creates assignment, rejects competing applications).
- Agency member delegation for accepted agency jobs.
- Job completion.

**Notifications (`apps/notifications`)**

- In-app notification records.
- Email dispatch via Django's configurable mail backend (`EMAIL_BACKEND` in settings).
- `send_admin_new_account_email` task: ✅ implemented and tested.
- Other notification triggers: placeholder — not yet wired.

**Feedback (`apps/feedback`)**

- Two-way reviews after completion.
- Cleaner rating summary updates.

**Calendars (`apps/calendars`)**

- Calendar conflict API.
- Google Calendar sync: placeholder.
- iCal feed polling: placeholder.
- iCal export for hosts/cleaners: planned.

**Configuration (`config/`)**

- `settings.py`: loads env via python-dotenv; DATABASE_URL absent → SQLite, present → PostgreSQL; full email backend config block; `FRONTEND_URL` for outbound email links.
- `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`: all call `load_dotenv(path, override=False)` before Django setup so `.env` is available from the first import.
- `celery.py`: Celery app wiring.

### Frontend — what exists

**`frontend/lib/api.ts`** — all API calls must go through `apiFetch`. It:

- Sets `Content-Type: application/json` only when `body` is a `string` — not for `FormData`.
- Reads `csrftoken` cookie and adds `X-CSRFToken` header on POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE.
- Returns raw `Response` — callers check `.ok` and call `.json()`.
- `CurrentUser` interface includes: `id`, `email`, `role`, `account_status`, `full_name`, `is_platform_admin`.

**`frontend/next.config.mjs`** — critical config:

- `trailingSlash: true` — required so Next.js does not strip slashes before Django sees them.
- Two rewrite rules matching `/api/:path*/` and `/api/:path*` — required to preserve trailing slashes through to Django's `APPEND_SLASH`.

**`frontend/app/page.tsx`** — public landing page:

- Auth-aware header: shows role-correct dashboard link when logged in.

**`frontend/app/login/page.tsx`** — session login, redirects to `/` after success.

**`frontend/app/signup/page.tsx`** — role-based signup (host / cleaner / agency), redirects to `/app` after success.

**`frontend/app/app/page.tsx`** — generic workspace:

- Auto-redirects: hosts → `/host`, admins → `/admin`.
- For cleaners/agencies: shows account status.

**`frontend/app/admin/page.tsx`** — admin approval panel:

- Gate: redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated, shows "Admin only" if not admin role.
- Fetches all accounts, client-side filters by status.
- Reads `?filter=pending` URL param via `useSearchParams()` to pre-select tab — used in admin notification email approval links.
- Approve: `POST /api/accounts/users/{id}/approve/`.
- Reject: `POST /api/accounts/users/{id}/reject/`.

**`frontend/app/host/page.tsx`** — host dashboard:

- Properties section: add property via modal.
- Jobs & Calendar section: month calendar grid, post job, publish job.
- **ICS import** — two-step modal:
  - Step 1: upload `.ics` file, select property, set default cleaning start time.
  - Step 2: review parsed events (checkin, checkout, nights), select/deselect, confirm.
  - Calls `POST /api/properties/parse-ics/` with `FormData` (multipart).
  - Creates one Draft job per selected event checkout date via `POST /api/marketplace/jobs/`.

### What is NOT built yet (next priorities)

1. **`/cleaner` dashboard** — cleaner profile view, browse open jobs, apply for a job (`POST /api/marketplace/applications/`).
2. **Applications panel in host dashboard** — host sees applications per job, calls `POST /api/marketplace/applications/{id}/accept/`.
3. **`/agency` dashboard** — agency manages members, views assigned jobs.
4. **Cleaner verification** — admin marks cleaner as verified before they can apply.
5. **Real search on landing page** — connect to `GET /api/accounts/cleaners/` with location filter.
6. **Google Calendar sync** — OAuth flow and feed polling (backend placeholders exist).
7. **iCal export** — generate `.ics` for host and cleaner calendars.
8. **Additional notification triggers** — application submitted, application accepted/rejected, assignment created, upcoming reminder, review prompt.

## Before Making Changes

Check the current repository state and read the relevant docs first. For product, marketplace, launch, monetization, or success-metric changes, read `BUSINESS.md` before proposing or editing technical implementation.

If Git reports a safe-directory ownership warning:

```powershell
git config --global --add safe.directory "C:/Users/d.yordanov/OneDrive - Intelligent Systems Bulgaria Ltd/Personal/Personal Projects/AirBnbMarketplace/airbnb_tax"
```

Only run commands that match the current project state. This repository may contain documentation before it contains application scaffolding.

## Handoff Expectations

Every substantial change should end with:

- What changed.
- What tests or checks were run.
- Any commands that failed and why.
- Any follow-up work that is genuinely needed.
